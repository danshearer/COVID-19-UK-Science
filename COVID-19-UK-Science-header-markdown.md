> What actions should we take when we are getting conflicting advice from
> seemingly-authoritative sources? Non-specialist citizens are planning their
> lives, and the medical science of COVID-19 is for specialists with
> experience. In the UK citizens have found it difficult to understand the
> political and administrative communication of policy. On 20th March 2020 the
> UK government at Westminster finally published the scientific advice they
> have been relying on, and the international science and technology community
> commenced its review. This document focusses on just a few of the hundreds of
> points in the UK scientific evidence. These conclusions do not always agree
> with what the UK Prime Minister and his staff have been saying, and citizens
> may choose to direct their actions accordingly.
