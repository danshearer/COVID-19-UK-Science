> What actions should we take when we are getting conflicting advice
> from seemingly-authoritative sources? On 20th March 2020 the UK government
> published its science advice in non-technical form we can take advantage of
> the intense international review. This document focusses on just a few of the
> hundreds of points in the UK scientific evidence, including the ones to do
> with my speciality. The UK scientific evidence does not always agree with
> what the UK Prime Minister and his staff have been saying, and both
> deliberately contradict what the World Health Organisation strongly
> recommends from experience in hundreds of countries. Citizens of the UK,
> especially in England, should be sceptical of inconsistent statements made by
> UK-level ministers about when the lockdown should lift, what the
> England-level strategy is, and what behaviour is acceptable. UK-level
> ministers have no authority over COVID-19 measures and enforcement on the
> 10.7 million UK citizens of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland although
> they often speak as if UK-level control exists (it doesn't, although as
> always UK constitutional matters are a mess.) The proposed UK-level tracking
> app does not yet exist but the design plans seem deeply flawed and the app
> should not be trusted by UK citizens, certainly not as the claimed
> replacement for WHO recommendations.
