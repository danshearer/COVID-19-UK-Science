> What actions should we take when we are getting conflicting advice from
> seemingly-authoritative sources? Citizens are planning their lives, and since
> on 20th March 2020 the UK government published its science advice in
> non-technical form we can take advantage of the intense international review.
> This document focusses on just a few of the hundreds of points in the UK
> scientific evidence, including the ones to do with my speciality. These
> conclusions do not always agree with what the UK Prime Minister and his staff
> have been saying, and citizens may choose to direct their actions
> accordingly.
