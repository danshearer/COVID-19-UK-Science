abstract: What actions should we take when we are getting conflicting advice from seemingly-authoritative sources? Citizens are planning their lives, and since on 20th March 2020 the UK government published its science advice in non-technical form we can take advantage of the intense international review. This document focusses on just a few of the hundreds of points in the UK scientific evidence, including the ones to do with my speciality. These conclusions do not always agree with what the UK Prime Minister and his staff have been saying, which in turn is very far from what the World Health Organisation is saying. Citizens of the UK, especially in England, should be sceptical of the often-contradictory statements made by UK-level ministers about when the lockdown should lift, what the England-level strategy is, and what behaviour is acceptable and compare them to what WHO is advising and what other countries are implementing. UK-level ministers have zero authority over COVID-19 measures and enforcement on the 10.7 million UK citizens of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland although they often speak as if UK-level control exists. It doesn't, although for the moment there is a 4-nations coordination agreement.
