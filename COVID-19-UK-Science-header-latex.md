abstract: What actions should we take when we are getting conflicting advice
from seemingly-authoritative sources? Citizens are planning their lives, and
since on 20th March 2020 the UK government published its science advice in
non-technical form we can take advantage of the intense international review.
This document focusses on just a few of the hundreds of points in the UK
scientific evidence, including the ones to do with my speciality. These
conclusions do not always agree with what the UK Prime Minister and his staff
have been saying, and citizens may choose to direct their actions accordingly.
